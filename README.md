# Regression Modeling Analysis of Smoking Behavior Dataset

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationships between smoking behavior and various health indicators, including cholesterol levels, weight and blood pressure. Utilizing a dataset focused on smoking behavior, we employed regression modeling techniques to uncover significant predictors and their impacts on health outcomes. This analysis aims to provide insights into public health implications related to smoking.

The regression analysis involves exploring correlations, developing predictive models and visualizing results to understand better how smoking behavior influences health metrics. The findings from this project may contribute to public health strategies aimed at reducing smoking-related health risks.

## Key Features
- **Regression Analysis**: Comprehensive statistical analysis to identify key predictors of health outcomes associated with smoking.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed and validated regression models to forecast health outcomes based on smoking behavior.
- **Visualization of Results**: Clear visual representation of model results, including regression coefficients and diagnostic plots.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R programming language**
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **ggplot2**: For advanced data visualization.
- **caret**: For building and validating regression models.
- **lmtest**: For conducting diagnostic tests on regression models.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - The smoking behavior dataset was loaded and prepared for analysis.
    - Missing values and outliers were identified and addressed to refine the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Summary statistics and visualizations were generated to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

3. **Regression Modeling**:
    - Regression models were developed to assess the influence of smoking behavior on health indicators, with significance determined through p-values and adjusted R-squared values.
    - Key predictors were identified and interpreted.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Diagnostic plots were created to assess model assumptions and performance, including residual analysis and multicollinearity checks.

5. **Visualization**:
    - Coefficient plots and other visualizations were generated to summarize the regression findings and highlight significant predictors.

## Visualizations

### Coefficient Plot
The coefficient plot visualizes the impact of smoking behavior and other predictors on health outcomes, highlighting statistically significant associations.

### Residual Plot
The residual plot provides insights into the model fit, helping to diagnose potential issues with linearity or homoscedasticity.

## Results

The analysis identified several significant predictors of health outcomes related to smoking behavior. These findings illustrate how smoking influences cholesterol levels, weight, and blood pressure, underscoring the importance of addressing smoking in public health initiatives. The regression models, after thorough evaluation, enhance our understanding of the health risks associated with smoking.
